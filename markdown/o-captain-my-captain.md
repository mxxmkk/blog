# O Captain! My Captain!
I have seen less and less superhero, action, sci-fi or fantasy and more with accent on drama and tragedy of life in the last years. I noticed how much I value honesty and hate on the phoniness of imaginary world that elevate my expectations of reality and people.

"Dead Poets Society" film by Peter Weir and genius Robin Williams (as John Keating) in a nutshell is a story about a group of young American man in the 1950's that get inspired in the first lesson by their new professor — *carpe diem* — maxim that will haunt their thoughts and actions throughout the film and lead their journey of becoming who they wish to be.

This film also resonated with me because I too see my self in a similar situation and I wish my life had a mentor like such in the movie. To show beauty; to teach perspective and thinking; to not press with authority but gentleness. 

In words of Keating — poetry and beauty is the sense of one's life; what makes a person part of a human race is art. One's creation might be of common situation, simple life aspects familiar to everyone, but one's creation shall not be ordinary. 

Stories like this encourage and inspire to act; aftermath is a feeling of unspoken excitement and determination that must find a way out. To create, to see, to share, to find that tiny spark that most people carry with caution and fear of disturbing and to fuel into fire. Primary flame of creation and curiosity. The wild and catching fire of life that will not spare an indifferent mind.

To give meaning and show that to you, o Captain! shall not be forgotten and your teaching shall never fade into darkness. Eviva la arte!
