        <p>Picture this. You play a video game, a casual open world RPG. When creating your character you know that you
            will spend the next dozens of hours with him. You carefully choose the stats, personality and path for him.
            You don't know what kind of story awaits your character but that doesn't stop you from still spending your
            skill points. You must do it anyway and only then the story unfolds. You are not anxious about those aspects
            because you know that you will level up and will have the opportunity to adjust your skill set later if
            needed. </p>
            <br>
        <p>Now, lets apply the same logic to everyday life. Why should we be afraid of making choices? Why be scared of
            commitment? You probably have years of life in front of you, so why bother worrying? The world will change
            and you will along side it. You won't waste your time if spent on some silly hobby or irregular activity. By
            the end of the year you will look back and say: "It was a good one" not (only) because of the progress made
            but life lived. </p>
            <br>
        <p>Not everything could be measured with wealth. Some things are precious just because they are and they are
            individual. So don't think of every choice as step upwards, I am sure there is plenty to explore on your
            current level. Discover new things, stick to things that work and drop those that don't.</p>

        <p>Another thing I should learn myself first...</p>
